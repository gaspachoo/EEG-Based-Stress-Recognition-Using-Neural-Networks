# üß† EEG-Based Stress Level Classification Using CNNs  

## üìå Project Overview  
This project explores the application of **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** for classifying stress levels based on **EEG data**. It includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, aiming to improve classification accuracy through advanced neural network architectures and signal processing techniques.  

## üìö Project Structure  
The repository is organized as follows:  

- **`Data/`** ‚Äì Contains EEG datasets used for training and evaluation, including those downloaded and those generated using `filter_all_data.py` 
- **`support_func/`** ‚Äì Includes auxiliary Python scripts for data processing and model support:
   - ***`cleaning_algos.py`*** ‚Äì Contains mutliple data processing algorithms.
   - ***`dataset_class.py`*** ‚Äì Defines the EEG dataset structure.
   - ***`early_stopping_class.py`*** ‚Äì Defines the Early Stopping class.
   - ***`filter_all_data.py`*** ‚Äì Implements filtering techniques for EEG signal preprocessing.  
   - ***`import_data.py`*** ‚Äì Defines the functions to import data, labels and split behind train/val datasets.  
   - ***`model_processing.py`*** ‚Äì Handles train generating, loading, training, under and over-sampling.  
   - ***`NN_classes.py`*** ‚Äì Contains neural network architectures, including CNN-based models.
   - ***`results_evaluation.py`*** ‚Äì Implements functions to show the results and plot confusion matrix.  
- **`date_analysis.ipynb`** ‚Äì Jupyter Notebook for exploring the dataset and displaying multiple plots.
- **`main.py`** ‚Äì Main script for model evaluation and performance testing.  
- **`subject_head_with_electrodes.png`** ‚Äì Visual representation of EEG electrode placements.  

## üìä Dataset  
The dataset comprises EEG recordings labeled with corresponding stress levels.  
In the **`Data/`** directory, you can find the downloaded data `artifcat_removal`, `raw_data`, `filtered_data`, `Coordinates.locs`, `scales.xls` and my own folders, named `[filtering_method]_filtered_data`.

## üî¨ Models Implemented 
- **SimpleNN**: A basic fully connected neural network that flattens EEG input, applies two hidden layers with ReLU activation, and outputs raw scores for classification.  
- **EEG_CNN**: A 1D CNN model with three convolutional layers, batch normalization, and max-pooling, followed by fully connected layers for EEG feature extraction and classification.  
- **SimpleNN2**: A refined version of SimpleNN with batch normalization and dropout for regularization, reducing overfitting while maintaining a simple architecture.  
- **EEG_CNN2**: A lighter CNN model with fewer filters and dropout layers, balancing complexity and generalization for EEG-based classification.  
- **EEG_CNN_GRU**: A hybrid CNN-GRU model that extracts spatial EEG features using CNN and captures temporal dependencies with a GRU layer before classification.  

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Requirements
